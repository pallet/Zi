# Release Notes

# 0.4.5

  Provides a mechanism for disabling clojure.test test namespaces

- Allow specification of codox output writer

## 0.4.3
- Allow tests to override core.test/report before redef'ing.
  Some test frameworks, such as midje register additional defmethods for
  core.test/report. By requiring the test namespaces before the report var
  is redef'ed to a function, these test frameworks become supported.

- Add note about source jars to readme

## 0.4.2

- ring gen files : listener-class and servlet-class in web.xml should point
  to the class file (no '-', use '_' instead)

- Update to ritz 0.2.0
